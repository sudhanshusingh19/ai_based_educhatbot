# Abstract
The project is an AI-based EduChat Bot that provides intelligent tutoring and assistance based on user input.
It uses AI models (NLP, Deep Learning, and ChatGPT) to generate personalized educational responses.
The system is a web app with:
Backend: Flask
Frontend: React.js
Database: MySQL (for storing chat history and user preferences)
Features:
       ✅ User login/signup
✅ AI-powered responses (tutoring, FAQs, and guidance)
✅ Subject-based assistance (Math, Science, History, etc.)
✅ Personalized learning paths
✅ Chat history storage
✅ Dashboard for easy learning tracking
The EduChat Bot helps students and learners get instant, AI-driven educational support efficiently. 🚀
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered educational chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology. This system aims to automate and enhance learning experiences by utilizing deep learning models like NLP, Transformers, and LLMs.
It will allow users to input their questions, subjects, and learning preferences, and the AI will generate personalized, high-quality educational responses.
# Existing system
The current knowledge-sharing process relies heavily on traditional methods and basic digital platforms.
Educators and professionals use tools like Google Classroom, Moodle, or Microsoft Teams, which require significant time and effort.
The process involves content creation, structuring lessons, responding to queries, and refining explanations based on user feedback.
Online forums and static knowledge bases exist, but they often lack personalization and real-time assistance.
Manual knowledge dissemination requires expertise, making it less scalable and time-consuming for institutions and businesses.
# Module Discription
USER INPUT: User enters a query or selects a topic for learning. 
Frontend UI: Displays responses and allows real-time interaction with the chatbot. 
Backend API: Handles requests and communicates with the AI model. 
AI Model Processing: Uses ML/NLP models to understand and generate responses. 
Response Generation: AI provides accurate and relevant educational answers. 
Database (MySQL): Stores user queries, chatbot responses, and learning progress. 
User Refinement: Allows feedback-based improvements for better learning assistance. 
Final Output: Users receive explanations, quizzes, and study materials in text, audio, or PDF formats.
